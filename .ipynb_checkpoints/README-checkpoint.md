### The forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb file is my assignment the starter_code.ipynb file was the starting code.

## Screenshots of graphs and charts can be found in the resources folder.

Still have to complete the "Create a Time Series Model with Prophet" section. I ran out of time for now.

### The red error boxes do not appear when I viewed the code in Google Colab. It seems to happen when not viewed in Colab or when exported. Please see screenshots to view my charts.
